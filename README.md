# The Kids from Room 502

This application is an automatic assistant that 
comes to the aid of a medical student. It was developed within
the course _ITSG_ by the team __The Kids from Room 502__, 
consisting of __Cotutiu Ioana, Drimba Alexandru, Duma Iulia 
Ana-Maria, Filipciuc Andreea, Gherghel Denisa-Maria__.

This README is intended to be a brief user manual for the 
developed application.

## Running the app
In order to open the app, the file __app.py__ must be run. 

## Functionalities
TODO add these

## Logs
For easier debugging, the messages printed in the console start with 
_INFO, WARN_ and _ERROR_. As further improvements, at least for 
_WARN_ and _ERROR_, special dialogs can be added to inform the 
user of the occurrence of these events.

## Known issues
1. The plot for the first opened NIFTI image is not responsive. 
This problem does not persist from the second image onwards.
2. Closing the app using the __X__ button does not kill the process. 
The app should be closed using the menu _File -> Exit_
